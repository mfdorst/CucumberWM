# CucumberWM: My configuration of [UmberWM]

If you want to use this configuration as a starting point, you will need to either

1. Update `Cargo.toml` to point to `umberwm` on [`crates.io`][1]
    ```toml
    umberwm = "0.0.20"
    ```
    or,

2. Clone `umberwm` yourself and update `path` to its location on your system.
    ```toml
    umberwm = { path = "/path/to/umberwm" }
    ```
